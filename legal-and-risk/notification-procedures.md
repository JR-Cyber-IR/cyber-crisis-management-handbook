Step-by-step procedures for notifying regulatory authorities, customers, and stakeholders during cybersecurity incidents.

---

## ⏳ Pre-Incident Preparation

Maintain an updated list of regulatory contacts:

- **Data Protection Authority (DPA)** - National supervisory authority
- **National Cybersecurity Authority** - Security regulator
- **Industry-Specific Regulators** - Sector-specific contacts
- **Customer Escalation Contacts** - Customer notification channels
- **Legal Counsel** - Internal and external legal contacts
- **PR/Communications** - Media relations contacts

Develop and pre-approve notification templates that comply with regulatory requirements in multiple languages.

## 🕜 Incident Assessment Phase

**Step 1: Determine Affected Data Types** (1 hour)
- Personal data (names, SSN, contact info)
- Financial data (credit cards, bank accounts)
- Health data (medical records)
- Proprietary data (intellectual property)
- Authentication credentials

**Step 2: Risk Assessment** (4 hours)
- **High Risk**: Direct personal data exposure, ransomware with exfiltration

- **Low Risk**: Data accessed but not exfiltrated

**Step 3: Determine Applicable Regulations** (2 hours)
Consult the Regulatory Landscape document:
- EU Regulations (RGPD, NIS2, DORA)
- US Regulations (SEC, State Laws, HIPAA)
- International Regulations (PIPEDA, Privacy Act)

**Step 4: Identify Regulatory Bodies** (4 hours)
- Primary supervisor/competent authority
