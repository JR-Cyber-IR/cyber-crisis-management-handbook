## 🧩 Fundamental Principles

### 1. Clarity of Authority
Decisions must have a **clear owner**.

Decisions should be **reversible when possible**, but timely.

Internal and external communication must be **consistent and coordinated**.

### 4. Business First, Security Informed
Technical input supports decisions, but **business impact drives priorities**.

### 5. Structured Coordination
Clear roles, rituals, and reporting prevent chaos.

- Post-crisis review
