# 🏛️ Cyber Crisis Governance

This section defines the **governance model** for managing a cyber crisis.

Effective crisis management depends less on tools and more on:
- Clear authority
- Defined roles
- Structured decision-making
- Predictable escalation paths

Governance ensures that **decisions are made quickly, coherently, and at the right level**.
