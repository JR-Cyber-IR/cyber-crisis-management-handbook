# 🧠 Decision-Making Framework

Cyber crisis decisions are made under uncertainty and time pressure.
This framework ensures decisions are **structured, documented, and revisitable**.

## 🧩 Decision Model

For each major decision, document:

| Element | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Decision | What needs to be decided |
| Context | Known facts and assumptions |
| Options | Available choices |
| Risks | Risks associated with each option |
| Recommendation | Preferred option |
| Decision Owner | Who decides |
| Timestamp | When the decision was made |

## 🧠 Guiding Rules

- Prefer reversible decisions when possible
- Time-box discussions
- Accept uncertainty explicitly
- Record rationale, not just outcome
