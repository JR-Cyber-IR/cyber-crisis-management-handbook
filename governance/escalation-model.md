# 🚦 Escalation Model

The escalation model defines **when an incident becomes a crisis**
and when executive-level governance is activated.

## 🧩 Escalation Criteria

| Trigger | Example |
|-------|--------|
| Business Impact | Critical services unavailable |
| Data Impact | Sensitive data compromised |
| Reputational Risk | Media exposure likely |
| Legal Exposure | Mandatory notification required |
| Control Loss | Attacker persistence or lateral movement |

## 🧠 Escalation Levels

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Technical incident (SOC / IR) |
| Level 2 | Major incident (Management informed) |
| Level 3 | Cyber crisis (Crisis cell activated) |

---

## 🧠 Key Rule

> Escalation should be **easy and reversible**.  
> Delayed escalation causes more harm than early activation.
